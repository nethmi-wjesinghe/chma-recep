<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h4>1 ½ cups cups uncooked short-grain rice (such as kekulu haal, white Calrose, or white jasmine)</h4><br>

<h4>3 cups water, plus more for rinsing rice</h4><br>

<h4>2 cardamom pods (optional)</h4><br>

<h4>1 (13 1/2 -ounce) can coconut milk.</h4><br>

<h4>½ teaspoon salt</h4>

<h1>Directions</h1>

<p>Place rice in a medium saucepan; add water to cover. Swirl rice to rinse, and drain. Repeat process twice, pouring off as much water as possible. Add 3 cups water and cardamom, if using, to rice; bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until water is mostly absorbed, about 15 minutes.

Uncover rice; stir in coconut milk and salt. Cook over low, stirring often, until coconut milk is mostly absorbed and mixture is creamy and thick, about 5 minutes. Discard cardamom. Transfer rice to a platter or baking sheet; top with a piece of parchment paper. Spread rice into a 1 1/2-inch-thick rectangle; use a spatula to flatten top. Let cool at room temperature until set, about 5 minutes. Remove parchment paper; cut rice into 3-inch squares or diamonds.
